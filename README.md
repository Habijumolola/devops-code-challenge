# Overview
This repository contains a React frontend, and an Express backend that the frontend connects to.

# Objective
Deploy the frontend and backend to somewhere publicly accessible over the internet. The AWS Free Tier should be more than sufficient to run this project, but you may use any platform and tooling you'd like for your solution.

Fork this repo as a base. You may change any code in this repository to suit the infrastructure you build in this code challenge.

# Submission
1. A github repo that has been forked from this repo with all your code.
2. Modify this README file with instructions for:
* Any tools needed to deploy your infrastructure
* All the steps needed to repeat your deployment process
* URLs to the your deployed frontend.

# Evaluation
You will be evaluated on the ease to replicate your infrastructure. This is a combination of quality of the instructions, as well as any scripts to automate the overall setup process.

# Setup your environment
Install nodejs. Binaries and installers can be found on nodejs.org.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

For macOS or Linux, Nodejs can usually be found in your preferred package manager.
https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/

Depending on the Linux distribution, the Node Package Manager `npm` may need to be installed separately.

# Running the project
The backend and the frontend will need to run on separate processes. The backend should be started first.
```
cd backend
npm ci
npm start
```
The backend should response to a GET request on `localhost:8080`.

With the backend```
cd frontend
npm ci
npm start
```
The frontend can be accessed at `localhost:3000`. If the frontend successfully connects to the backend, a message saying "SUCCESS" followed by a guid should be displayed on the screen.  If the connection failed, an error message will be displayed on the screen.

# Configuration
The frontend has a configuration file at `frontend/src/config.js` that defines the URL to call the backend. This URL is used on `frontend/src/App.js#12`, where the front end will make the GET call during the initial load of the page.

The backend has a configuration file at `backend/config.js` that defines the host that the frontend will be calling from. This URL is used in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` CORS header, read in `backend/index.js#14`

# Deployment
 Deployment on AWS ec2 instance using ubuntu OS.
 First you need to create EC2 instance .
 Connect user instance using key.pem using ssh on your system if you are using windows use puttey to connect the instance.
 After connecting the instance update it using " sudo apt-get update"
 Install git " sudo apt-get install git "
 Install Nodejs and npm
 Install pm2 server "npm install pm2 -g"
 the go to backend open config.js and change localhost to instance ip
 same in the frontend config.js file change the localhost to instance ip
 
Now run backend
cd backend
npm install
pm2 start index.js
the backend will hosted on http://3.144.238.149:8080/

Now run frontend
cd frontend
npm insatll
pm2 start 'npm start'
the fronten will hosted on http://3.144.238.149:3000/

Now go to security group of the instance and add inbound rule
add port 8080 for backend 
add port 3000 for frontend 

The frontend will fetch the id from backend.
url for frontend 
http://3.144.238.149:3000/


# Optional Extras
The core requirement for this challenge is to get the provided application up and running for consumption over the public internet. That being said, there are some opportunities in this code challenge to demonstrate your skill sets that are above and beyond the core requirement.

A few examples of extras for this coding challenge:
1. Dockerizing the application
2. Scripts to set up the infrastructure
3. Providing a pipeline for the application deployment
4. Running the application in a serverless environment

This is not an exhaustive list of extra features that could be added to this code challenge. At the end of the day, this section is for you to demonstrate any skills you want to show thatâ€™s not captured in the core requirement.
